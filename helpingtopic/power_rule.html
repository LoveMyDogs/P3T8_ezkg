        <p class="text-secondary">Admittedly one the the simpler concepts learned for derivatives, that sets the base for most operations in the future, in this article it'll largely be a refresher in the case you've forgotten</p>
        <h2>What is Power Rule?</h2>
        <p>Power Rule, in it's applied state, is just knowing that the derivative of b*x^n = nb*x^(n-1) add image here of showing this but in nicer format</p>
        <p>Or rather to speak of it's actual significance, it's the base derivative format you'll use in almost every situation you deal with derivatives in the future, set up by extremely tedious limit work that one suffers on.</p>
        <h2>That's Right, Definition of the Derivative</h2>
        <p>Does this phrasing bring you bad memories? Me too! Well, you can't escape from it, as it'll show up in both AP Calculus AB and BC, so here's the four formats available ADD IMAGE HERE OF FOUR FORMATS</p>
        <p>I'd highly recommend memorizing all of these, as you might not have to solve it, but, hint hint, it'll help you through a few multiple choice problems in the future if you know how these work</p>
        <p>Now here's working through each of them, to give a refresher, ADD IMAGE HEEEEERE</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>That's pretty much the most important parts of power rule and it's annoying subset, although don't tell your teachers I paired them together, as definition of the derivative isn't just for power rule(See: trig and log derivatives). Hope it's a nice refresher!</p>
